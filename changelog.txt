Change log 0.8 (under development)
----------------------------------
* The junit4 test module now work with JUnit 4.5 (although using the old, now deprecated, approach of JUnit 4.4).
* Upgraded to EasyMock 2.4
* Upgraded to JavaAssist 3.8.0.GA
* Fixed the error message that was thrown when a constructor was not found when using mocks as arguments with mockMethod.
* WhiteBox invoke method and invoke constructor methods now throws an IllegalArgumentException if the first argument is null.
* Replay/verify works as expected when mixing classes and instance mocks.
* Better error message when expectNew fails due to too few calls to new when a method was invoked using reflection.
* Implemented support for nice mocks.
* Added more documentation
* expectNew(..).andThrow(..) now works with checked exceptions
* Added WhiteBox functionality to instantiate a class without invoking its constructor without using byte-code manipulation. Works in multiple JVM's.
* mockMethodX is renamed to createPartialMockX        
* Suppress constructor code now works as expected
* mockConstruction(..) was removed. You should always use expectNew(..) instead. There's a utility method in PowerMock called createMockAndExpectNew can be used as a substitute for mockConstruction(..). 
* Better error message when a class is not replayed when doing expectNew.
* Added support to easy suppress several methods in the same class.
* doInvokeMethod in PowerMock now catches and deals correctly with InvocationTargetExceptions.
* It's now possible to run a single test case in junit4
* Test delegates now implements Sortable
* Added support for mocking classes in signed jar files
* EasyMock matchers now works in combination with PowerMock's expectPrivate(..)
                             
Change log 0.7 (released)
-------------------------
* Do not mock hashCode and equals
* Added ugly hack for cglib classloading issue with maven
* Fixed problems with mocking methods in superclass and modifying multiple classes with same parent
* Strict mocking with interface work as expected
* Added niceReplayAndVerify
* Added logo and improved documentation structure
* Follow EasyMock semantics for partial mocking
* WhiteBox internalstate support for static fields as expected
* Updated assembly and create sources jar files

Change log 0.6 (released)
-------------------------
* Updated to EasyMock 2.3 and classextension 2.3
* Implemented support for ConstructorArgs
* Implemented support for StrictMock
* Added possibility to invoke a private method in a subclass of an instance using Whitebox.
* Added a support for test classes extending from TestCase when using a custom JUnit runner such as PowerMockRunner. This fix was created for both JUnit4 legacy and JUnit 4.4. 
* Major internal refactoring.
* Fixed major classloading and byte-code manipulation issues. Code coverage tools such as EMMA now works.
* Fixed so that it's now possible to invoke private methods using non-primitive and/or non-wrapper values.
* Whitebox now throws the correct exceptions to the client and not a wrapped RuntimeException. This means for example that expectNew(..).andThrow(..) works as expected.
* Fixed a bug in the PowerMock JUnit 4.4 and legacy runner that reported back the wrong number of tests being executed when @Ignore was used.
