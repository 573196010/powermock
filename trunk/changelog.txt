Change log 0.6
--------------
* Updated to EasyMock 2.3 and classextension 2.3
* Implemented support for ConstructorArgs
* Implemented support for StrictMock
* Added possibility to invoke a private method in a subclass of an instance using Whitebox.
* Added a support for test classes extending from TestCase when using a custom JUnit runner such as PowerMockRunner. This fix was created for both JUnit4 legacy and JUnit 4.4. 
* Mayor internal refactoring.
* Fixed mayor classloading and byte-code manipulation issues. Code coverage tools such as EMMA now works.
* Fixed so that it's now possible to invoke private methods using non-primitive and/or non-wrapper values.
* Whitebox now throws the correct exceptions to the client and not a wrapped RuntimeException. This means for example that expectNew(..).andThrow(..) works as expected.
