		 * the ReportDao class (since we'd wanted to mock the
		 * getReportFromTargetName method) the class under test is now actually
		 * a sub-class of ReportDao. This is because EasyMock creates a dynamic
		 * CGLib proxy which extends the ReportDao at run-time. So if we don't
		 * specify the ReportDao.class as the point in the class hierarchy where
		 * the cache field is located PowerMock will end up trying to looking
		 * for the cache field in the CGLib generated proxy where it'll
		 * obviously not find it.
